# Usage

## Accessing the data

The notebooks in this repository demonstrate how to process publicly available data from Human Brain Network (HBN) in a cloud platform. The HBN dataset includes multi-modal MRI scans in BIDS format, distributed under Creative Commons, Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike License. Further infomation about this dataset is available at [their website](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/MRI_EEG.html). 

## Running QSIprep

QSIprep is a pipeline for diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data in BIDS format. It automatically preprocess most kinds of dMRI data and outputs visual reports and QC metrics. Moreover, it can be used to run state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms.
