# Task Description
Patients were resting in the hospital bed, while single pulse stimulation was performed. The stimulation had a duration of 200 microseconds, was biphasic and had an amplitude of 6mA. For subject 7 stimulation amplitude was sometimes reduced to 4mA to minimize interictal responses.
